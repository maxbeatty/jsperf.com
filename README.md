# jsPerf.com source code

[jsPerf.com](http://jsperf.com/) runs on a server with Apache or Lighttpd,
MySQL and PHP installed.

## How to run a local copy of jsPerf for testing/debugging

1. Download the source code, as located within this repository.
2. The code expects things to be hosted at `/` and not a subdirectory. You might
   want to create a new virtual host, e.g. `dev.jsperf.com`.
4. Rename `_inc/config.sample.php` to `_inc/config.php` and enter your database
   credentials and other info.
5. For the Browserscope integration to work, you’ll need a Browserscope API key.
   To get one, sign in at [Browserscope.org](http://www.browserscope.org/) and
   then browse to [the settings page](http://www.browserscope.org/user/settings).
6. If you are using Apache, edit `.htaccess` (especially the first few lines)
   so it matches your current setup. If you are using Lighttpd, set up the
   `dev.jsperf.com` virtual host using the sample in `_inc/lighttpd.conf`.
7. If you plan on using the update script for Benchmark.js/Platform.js
   (`_tmp/build.php`), you’ll need to make some files writable.

   ```bash
   chmod 666 _js/benchmark.js _js/benchmark.src.js _js/platform.src.js\
   _js/ui.browserscope.src.js _js/ui.src.js _inc/version.txt
   ```

Note that both `include_path` and `open_basedir` must be set to `./:./_tpl/:./_tpl/tpl-inc/:./_inc/`.

With PHP 5.4 you can easily start an HTTP web server with these settings for quick testing:

    php -d include_path="./:./_tpl/:./_tpl/tpl-inc/:./_inc/" -d open_basedir="./:./_tpl/:./_tpl/tpl-inc/:./_inc/" -d session.save_path="_session" -S localhost:8000
